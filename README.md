# RoadDetector
Simple road detector using thresholding (it can be improved, but it was good enough to get me a 9.5 on my assignment)

In order for the .py to work, u need to have the two folders with the images in the same directory as the .py (should be easy to change)

Please note that it's commented in spanish 'cause I just wanted to make it easier for me to remember what does what, but it shouldn't be too hard to understand.
The main thing I've been told could be improved is pre-processing the images.
